# Time Tracker Script

## Description 
I found myself with a lot of free time and a lot of hobbies I just felt like I would forget a lot of them and just end up doing nothing useful with my time. So I decided to write something that will help keep track of the smaller things I would often forget about. Right now it's only a CLI but the logic can be expanded to a web application or directly ported to mobile using React or something similar. 

I was also trying to get better at using Pandas and Numpy for Data Processing so I figured this would be a fun way to get some practice. 
## How to use it
Just run it and follow the instructions :D 
It's pretty simple right now so there's not a lot to do in it
## Requirements
- Python (duh!) 
- Pip (to install the libraries) 
- Pandas
- Numpy 
Just run ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` to install all the requirements 

## TO DO
- Add the data processing stuff
	- Total time per week
	- Total time per day
	- Average time per day/week
	- Graphs (possibly using Seaborn or Matplotlib) 
- Clean up the code a bit 
- Input validation
